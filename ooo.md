  - context: |
	In metaphysics, object-oriented ontology (OOO) is a 21st-century 
	Heidegger-influenced school of thought that rejects the privileging 
	of human existence over the existence of nonhuman objects. 
	This is in contrast to post-Kantian philosophy's tendency to refuse 
	"speak[ing] of the world without humans or humans without the world". 
	Object-oriented ontology maintains that objects exist independently 
	(as Kantian noumena) of human perception and are not ontologically 
	exhausted by their relations with humans or other objects. 
	For object-oriented ontologists, all relations, 
	including those between nonhumans, distort their related objects 
	in the same basic manner as human consciousness and exist on an 
	equal ontological footing with one another.

	Object-oriented ontology is often viewed as a subset of speculative 
	realism, a contemporary school of thought that criticizes the post-Kantian 
	reduction of philosophical enquiry to a correlation between thought and 
	being (correlationism), such that the reality of anything outside of this 
	correlation is unknowable. Object-oriented ontology predates speculative 
	realism, however, and makes distinct claims about the nature and equality 
	of object relations to which not all speculative realists agree. 
	The term "object-oriented philosophy" was coined by Graham Harman, 
	the movement's founder, in his 1999 doctoral dissertation "Tool-Being: 
	Elements in a Theory of Objects". In 2009, Levi Bryant rephrased Harman's 
	original designation as "object-oriented ontology", giving the movement its current name.
    questions_and_answers:
    - question: |
      What is object-oriented ontology (OOO)?
      answer: |
      Object-oriented ontology (OOO) is a 21st-century metaphysical school of thought, influenced by Heidegger, that rejects the privileging of human existence over nonhuman objects. It asserts that objects exist independently of human perception and are not ontologically defined by their relations with humans or other objects.
    - question: |
      How does object-oriented ontology differ from post-Kantian philosophy?
      answer: |
      Object-oriented ontology contrasts with post-Kantian philosophy by rejecting "correlationism," the idea that reality cannot be discussed apart from the relationship between thought and being. It maintains that objects exist independently, akin to Kantian noumena, and are not solely defined by their relations to humans or other objects.
    - question: |
      What is the relationship between object-oriented ontology and speculative realism?
      answer: |
      Object-oriented ontology is often viewed as a subset of speculative realism, a contemporary school of thought critical of correlationism. However, OOO predates speculative realism and makes distinct claims about the equality of object relations, with which not all speculative realists agree.
    - question: |
      Who coined the term "object-oriented ontology"?
      answer: |
      The term "object-oriented ontology" was coined by Levi Bryant in 2009, who rephrased Graham Harman's original term "object-oriented philosophy" from his 1999 doctoral dissertation, "Tool-Being: Elements in a Theory of Objects."
    - question: |
      What does object-oriented ontology say about the relations between objects?
      answer: |
      Object-oriented ontology holds that all relations, including those between nonhuman objects, distort their related objects in the same fundamental way as human consciousness does. These relations exist on an equal ontological footing with one another.
